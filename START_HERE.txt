HOW TO USE
==========

► YC AI Assistant list (renewable top 50 companies)
   See: YC_PIPELINE_HOW_TO_USE.md
   Run: python yc_ai_assistant_ingest.py  →  result in yc_ai_assistant_companies.json

► Ben Lang list (paste & filter) (the list of companies) under the first line in paste_here.txt. Save.

2. Optional: Scroll down in paste_here.txt to "--- LINKS ---" and paste Ben Lang's COMMENT that has the career page links (the lines like "1) CHAMP - https://..."). Save. Then your result will show APPLY: <clickable link> for each company.

3. Double-click RUN_FILTER.bat.

4. Open result.txt. You get:
   - A short list (only remote/Panama + realistic for you).
   - For each company: APPLY link (if you pasted the links) or a note to search.
   - A short "How the analysis works" at the top.

HOW THE ANALYSIS WORKS
======================
  - Step 1 (location): We keep only companies whose locations include "remote" or "Panama". The rest are dropped (you're in Panama / want remote).
  - Step 2 (fit): We use your profile in elena_profile.txt (your skills and target roles from your resume). Each company is scored:
    - GOOD FIT = what they do matches your targets (AI, LLM, dev tools, API, etc.).
    - maybe = could be relevant.
    - avoid = we hide these so you don't waste time.
  So the result is fewer companies, with real apply links when you paste the links.
